# largest-file-Python
In this project, the goal is to create a Python script in a single file that will traverse the filesystem finding the largest files in a path.
Create a new Github repository with a README and a single python file.

Make your Python script accept an argument to traverse any path (don't hardcode the path!)

Use different options in the script for reporting, like:

No more than 20 files

Files larger  than a specific size in megabytes
